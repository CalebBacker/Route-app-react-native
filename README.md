Overview 

This semester, our team created an app that we expect will be easy and simple to use. When using the app, users will see two prompts indicating origin and destination.  When finished, enter the selected city , press the get route button. Users will have virtual routes being made on the map. And while the route being generated , users can enable toggle for rest stops to see all the rest stops being generated in that specific route. Users also are able to see the specification of rest stops differentiated by different colors. To save the route, users can simply press the save route button to rename and save the personalized route. To view the saved route, users can simply press view saved routes button.
